# Secure License Management System Architecture

## Overview

This system is designed for a desktop application that needs strong device binding, cryptographic verification, local offline support, and an administrative license workflow. It uses a server-side signing authority, a secure local client cache, and a browser-based admin dashboard.

## High-Level Components

1. Desktop Client SDK
   - Activates and verifies license files locally
   - Detects device fingerprint
   - Reads encrypted local license cache
   - Calls HTTPS APIs for synchronization

2. License Authority Backend
   - Stores customer, product, license, activation, device, and audit records
   - Signs each generated license with an Ed25519 private key
   - Validates activation, expiry, revocation, and device mismatch conditions

3. Admin Dashboard
   - Generates license keys
   - Manages customers, products, status, reactivation, and revocations
   - Monitors activation history and reports

4. Data Store
   - PostgreSQL or MySQL for production usage
   - JSON-backed file store for demo and local testing

## Security Design

- Ed25519 key pair for license signing and verification
- SHA-256 hashing for device fingerprints and integrity checks
- AES-256-GCM or AES-256-CBC encrypted local storage for cached license data
- Private key never installed in client app
- HTTPS only in production, with TLS certificates and HSTS enabled
- Signature verification and tamper detection before every activation and start-up check
- Monotonic date validation using server timestamps when online

## Core Workflow

1. Admin generates a license with a signed payload.
2. Client gathers hardware fingerprint and sends to server.
3. Server checks key validity, expiry, revocation, and device usage.
4. Server stores activation and binds the license to the device.
5. Client saves an encrypted local license file for offline validation.
6. On next launch, the client verifies the license signature, hash, and expiry.
7. If online, it syncs with the server and refreshes status.

## Recommended Production Deployment

- Frontend: React/Vite admin dashboard served behind HTTPS
- Backend: Node.js + Express or NestJS on a private API tier
- Database: PostgreSQL with strong indexing and audit logging
- Reverse Proxy: NGINX + TLS termination
- Secret Management: environment variables or vault-backed storage
- Monitoring: Prometheus, structured logs, and API alerting

## Integration Notes

The client SDK should be distributed as a small TypeScript/JavaScript module for your desktop app. The desktop app can call the SDK at startup and before premium features are enabled.
